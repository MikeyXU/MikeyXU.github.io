To myself, software engineering is a confusing topic because I have not yet written code to preform tasks,
except basic projects in my computer science courses.  From Machine Organization & Assembly Language, we
learned more about the bridge between software and hardware, called assembly language, which is a form of 
written software that interacts with the hardware.  I believe that this course is about using that code to
instruct our hardware to compute results and give us the desired outcome, and preform whatever task we need.
I think it is about creating, editing, and finalizing software that we write ourselves, in order to provide
a solution in apt time, using only necessary resources, with reliable methods.

One of the subjects that resonated with me in the reading was the Broken Window Theory about entropy, how if 
one thing goes awry, the entire system begins to crumble if we don't work to fix it, because I've faced that 
same issue before in my code, when I tried to continue on a project, only to discover that an error I faced 
earlier became much bigger because I didn't fully fix the problem, just moreover tried to sweep it under the rug.
Along with that, another coding issue I run into that was mentionted in the reading was knowing when to stop.  
There are only so many improvements to make on a project before the code becomes more or less "spaghetti code" if
you don't stop for a minute and take a step back.
