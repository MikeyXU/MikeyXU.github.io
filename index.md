To myself, software engineering is a confusing topic because I have not yet written code to preform tasks,
except basic projects in my computer science courses.  From Machine Organization & Assembly Language, we
learned more about the bridge between software and hardware, called assembly language, which is a form of 
written software that interacts with the hardware.  I believe that this course is about using that code to
instruct our hardware to compute results and give us the desired outcome, and preform whatever task we need.
I think it is about creating, editing, and finalizing software that we write ourselves, in order to provide
a solution in apt time, using only necessary resources, with reliable methods.
